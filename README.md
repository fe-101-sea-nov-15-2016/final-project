# Instructions

The final project is your chance to apply what you've learned about web development in this class to a project you can show your peers, instructors, and perhaps even potential employers.

The project can include basically any exploration of the front-end technologies you've learned in this class. That could be a website, a prototype front-end for a web application, or even a special CSS transition/animation sequence.

A working version of your final project should be deployed by the last day of class for final presentation of the project to the class and your instructor.
